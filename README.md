# Smart Cane for Visually Impaired

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals by developing a smart cane equipped with sensor-based obstacle detection and real-time audio feedback. The cane utilizes ultrasonic sensors and a buzzer module to alert users about obstacles, improving their navigation experience.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects.
- **Audio Feedback**: Alerts the user through a buzzer when an obstacle is detected.
- **IoT Integration**: Can be enhanced for remote monitoring and assistance.
- **Compact & Lightweight**: Designed to be easily carried and used by visually impaired individuals.

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino**: Microcontroller for processing sensor data.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Measures distance to detect obstacles.
- **IoT**: Can be extended for remote tracking and assistance.
- **Python**: Used for data processing and IoT integration.
- **Buzzer Module**: Provides audio feedback to alert users.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer Module
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply
- Cane (as a structural base)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Python (for extended IoT functionality)
- Embedded C for Arduino programming

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-cane.git
   ```
2. **Upload the Arduino Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE and upload the `smart_cane.ino` file to the Arduino board.
3. **Connect Hardware Components**:
   - Attach the ultrasonic sensors and buzzer module to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
4. **Run Python Code (If IoT enabled)**:
   - Install required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```
   - Run the Python script for remote data logging:
     ```bash
     python smart_cane.py
     ```

## Working Principle
- The ultrasonic sensors continuously scan for obstacles in the userâ€™s path.
- When an obstacle is detected within a predefined distance, the Arduino triggers the buzzer to alert the user.
- Optionally, the IoT integration can send real-time data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.

## Future Enhancements
- **GPS Integration**: To provide location tracking for caregivers.
- **AI-based Object Recognition**: To differentiate between types of obstacles.
- **Voice Feedback**: Implementing a speaker module for verbal alerts.
